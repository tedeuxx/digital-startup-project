# ðŸš€ My Digital Startup Project

**Empowering digital products with AI-augmented, security-first cloud infrastructure**  
_A long-term public project to build, learn, and share how to accelerate development using AWS services, generative AI tools, and startup-proven security practices._

## ðŸŒ± Purpose

As a cloud architect at AWS, I help businesses scale with cloud-native technologies. This project is my way of applying that same knowledge â€” outside working hours â€” to build a robust, secure, and cost-efficient foundation for future digital ventures.

Itâ€™s a long-term commitment to turn experience into ownership and prepare for the moment when building digital products becomes my main activity.

## ðŸ§± What You'll Find Here

This repository documents and implements a long-term, cloud-native architecture aligned with AWS best practices â€” designed to accelerate the creation of digital products using modern infrastructure, generative AI tools, and security by design. It includes:

- **Multi-account setup with AWS Control Tower**  
  Each digital product is isolated in its own AWS account pair (staging/production) to enforce security boundaries, simplify cost tracking, and accelerate deployment cycles with fewer environments.

- **Centralized authentication and fine-grained authorization**  
  Identity and access managed through **Amazon Cognito User Pools** and **Amazon Verified Permissions**, enabling secure, scalable auth flows and policy-based access control from day one.

- **Security-first infrastructure design**  
  Implementation of **least privilege IAM roles**, **resource-based policies**, **network segmentation (VPC, subnets, SGs)**, and **secure parameter and secret management** â€” using **AWS IAM**, **Secrets Manager**, and **SSM Parameter Store**.

- **PWA architecture for secure frontend delivery**  
  Progressive Web App built for a unified web/mobile experience, served securely via **Amazon CloudFront + S3** with **HTTPS, signed URLs**, and **Content Security Policies**.

- **AI-augmented development with Amazon Q Developer**  
  Leveraging **Amazon Q Developer** and similar tools to speed up development and documentation without sacrificing quality, consistency, or secure patterns.

- **End-to-end observability**  
  Native monitoring and tracing with **Amazon CloudWatch**, **X-Ray**, **CloudTrail**, and **GuardDuty**, enabling visibility, threat detection, and compliance auditability.

- **CI/CD with GitOps and container security**  
  Declarative pipelines using **Amazon EKS**, **ArgoCD**, and image scanning tools (like **ECR Scan** and **CodeGuru Security**) to ensure secure, traceable, and automated deployments.

- **Search and personalization services**  
  Ready-to-use modules for **Amazon OpenSearch Service** and **Amazon Personalize**, integrated securely with IAM and scoped access policies.

- **VOD streaming and media services**  
  Infrastructure support for secure, scalable **video-on-demand** applications with content protection strategies and distribution best practices.
